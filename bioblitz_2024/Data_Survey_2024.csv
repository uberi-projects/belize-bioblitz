Talking about the cool finds with the other members of the group was fun too!","For my group we had to pass behind people’s houses, so I’m guessing it’s in their yard. I’m not sure how understanding people can be for events like this. But luckily no one was around or angry about us passing through their property. I was just a little skeptical about that. ","A more punctual start for each event, and advertising the Bioblitz earlier in the year and also consistently advertising to increase the amount of people showing up and participating. Maybe even collecting some specimens and talking about them after everyone has returned back to the starting point."

It was enjoyable to go out and explore the biodiversity present at Mt. Pleasant Creek. I also like the execution of the event was properly planned out and I commend the Environmental Club’s Executive team as well as the experts present. Thank you for presenting new opportunities and activities for your members!!","I think that instead of the team scattering to make observations maybe we can stick together a bit more and do the observations together. Or have a time dedicated for this before scattering.","There isn’t much recommendations because it was an excellent event. My only recommendation is to make the conduction of the observations together in order to ensure everyone has more interaction and have the experts give more details on the species observed."
